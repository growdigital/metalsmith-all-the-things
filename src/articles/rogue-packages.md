## metalsmith-cloudinary

currently in github in `push` branch. Can install as a dependency with:

`npm i git://github.com/superwolff/metalsmith-cloudinary.git#push`

Nothing really outstanding on this, it can be merged into master and published.

## metalsmith-webpack

currently on github in `v2` branch, install with

`npm i git://github.com/christophercliff/metalsmith-webpack.git#v2`

## metalsmith-move

not sure if I'll publish this, you can probably get the same functionality with `metalsmith-permalinks`.
